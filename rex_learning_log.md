Notes/Tips, in other words, lessons learned through mistakes and debugging:

- name the `venv` specific to the project, not just `venv`, it took awhile to debug and config. Named the variable `.venv_deidentifier`
- write out plan first and then build in chunks and test code
- put logging module in each of the scripts
